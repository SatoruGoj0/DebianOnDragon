DebOnDragon for the Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 15Q8X10 (83N3, Snapdragon X X1-26-100).
Linux v7.2 kernel series `7.2.0-debondragon-2`.

**Installed system:** don't reinstall. Download `linux-image-7.2.0-debondragon-2_*.deb`,
`debondragon-support_*_all.deb` and `SHA256SUMS`, then follow
https://github.com/SatoruGoj0/DebianOnDragon/blob/main/docs/kernel-upgrade.md
The new kernel installs **next to** the old one. GRUB's "DebOnDragon kernels"
submenu boots either one with its own devicetree.

New in this kernel (implemented from hardware evidence; **not yet tested on hardware**):
- Touchpad: interrupt pull-up fix for the `incomplete report` floods
- Display brightness: PWM moved to pmk8550 GPIO 5
- HDMI: DP2 → DP-to-HDMI bridge
- Internal camera: usb_2 + eUSB2 repeater
- Audio: headphones, headset mic and internal mics (DSP topology and UCM come
  with debondragon-support; needs `debondragon-firmware`)
- Internal speakers: **opt-in** `-speakers` devicetree (no speaker protection on Linux)
- Fan/EC driver: built but **off by default**; check with `sudo debondragon-ec-check`

**New install:** write the ISO in DD mode, boot it from the USB-A port,
and keep Secure Boot off (https://github.com/SatoruGoj0/DebianOnDragon/blob/main/docs/install.md).
