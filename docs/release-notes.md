# DebOnDragon v0.4.0

Kernel `7.2.0-debondragon-4` (Linux v7.2) and `debondragon-support` 0.3.0.
Installs beside earlier kernels; don't reinstall Debian
(docs/kernel-upgrade.md, "Upgrade from v0.3.0").

## HDMI works

Verified on the 83N3 with a Samsung LS27D300G: 1920x1080@60 over a
4-lane HBR2 DisplayPort link to the HDMI converter (Parade PS176), extended
desktop under Hyprland with pointer and windows moving between screens.

The fix is one devicetree line: the DP lane orientation of the PHY that
feeds the converter (`data-lanes = <3 2 1 0>`; the earlier `<0 1 2 3>`
made link training fail). Kernel -4 is otherwise identical to -3.

`debondragon-support` 0.3.0 turns HDMI on automatically
(`DEBONDRAGON_HDMI=auto`) for kernels with this fix and keeps it off for
older ones; GRUB's "DebOnDragon kernels" submenu has a "HDMI off" entry
for -4 as a fallback. No sysfs commands needed.

**Not yet verified:** HDMI at boot and hotplug with the new automatic
setting, long runs, reboot and unplug/replug with active video (earlier
kernels reset the laptop on unplug after failed training). Tests:
docs/hdmi-testing.md.

Unchanged and still working: touchpad (TLMM 19), internal display, GPU,
brightness, camera, Wi-Fi, keyboard, touchscreen, USB-A.

# DebOnDragon v0.3.0

For the Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 15Q8X10 (83N3, Snapdragon X X1-26-100).
Kernel series `7.2.0-debondragon-3` (Linux v7.2) and `debondragon-support` 0.2.1.

**Installed system: don't reinstall.** The new kernel installs **beside**
7.2.0-debondragon-2. Test it once without changing the default:
https://github.com/SatoruGoj0/DebianOnDragon/blob/main/docs/kernel-upgrade.md
("Test a new kernel once, keeping the current one as default").

## Verified on hardware

- **Touchpad works** (kernel `7.2.0-debondragon-3`): its interrupt is on
  TLMM 19, decoded from the DSDT, not the CRD's TLMM 3. Interrupts arrive,
  libinput reports continuous pointer motion, normal use is fine.
- Kernel -3 boots; HDMI stays off (`video=HDMI-A-1:d`).
- Audio: the UCM profile now loads and PulseAudio offers a Headphones sink
  (was `auto_null`). Sound output itself is **not tested yet**.
- Confirmed on v0.2.0 and unchanged here: internal display and GPU
  acceleration, brightness control, camera, Wi-Fi, keyboard, touchscreen,
  USB-A, temperature sensors (on -3: display up, camera enumerates).

Still broken: HDMI (link training fails; unplugging used to reset the
laptop, hence off by default). The EC/fan driver's protocol doesn't match
this EC (driver stays off; the EC runs the fan itself).

## Changes

`debondragon-support` 0.2.1 (works with kernel -2 as well):
- **HDMI off by default** (`video=HDMI-A-1:d`), so the failing link is
  never enabled and there is nothing to tear down. Reversible:
  `DEBONDRAGON_HDMI=on` in `/etc/default/debondragon`, only to test a fix.
- **Brightness**: saved once a minute when it changed and restored exactly
  at boot; without a saved level, at least `DEBONDRAGON_MIN_BRIGHTNESS`
  (30%). Restore across a reboot not yet confirmed.
- **Audio profile** under the card's long name, which is what ALSA looks up
  (the short name is cut to 31 characters). Speakers stay off.
- **`DEBONDRAGON_DEFAULT_KERNEL`** pins GRUB's default to one kernel with
  its own devicetree, so a new kernel can be tried once with `grub-reboot`.

Kernel `7.2.0-debondragon-3`:
- **Touchpad interrupt on TLMM 19** (was the CRD's TLMM 3, which never
  fired), level-low with pull-up, decoded from the DSDT
  (`docs/board-notes.md`). **Verified on hardware.**
- **Absent PMIC (SPMI SID 0xa) disabled**: stops a failing probe and its
  boot WARNING. No working device used it.
- **`/dev/drm_dp_auxN`** (read-only HDMI diagnostics) and **lockup / hung
  task detectors** (report only, never reboot). HDMI link training is
  **not** fixed yet.
- USB tethering drivers (RNDIS, ipheth).

EC/fan driver: still blacklisted.

Previous release (v0.2.0):

DebOnDragon for the Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 15Q8X10 (83N3, Snapdragon X X1-26-100).
Linux v7.2 kernel series `7.2.0-debondragon-2`.

**Installed system:** don't reinstall. Download `linux-image-7.2.0-debondragon-2_*.deb`,
`debondragon-support_*_all.deb` and `SHA256SUMS`, then follow
https://github.com/SatoruGoj0/DebianOnDragon/blob/main/docs/kernel-upgrade.md
The new kernel installs **next to** the old one. GRUB's "DebOnDragon kernels"
submenu boots either one with its own devicetree.

New in this kernel (implemented from hardware evidence; **not yet tested on hardware**):
- Touchpad: interrupt pull-up fix for the `incomplete report` floods
- Display brightness: PWM moved to pmk8550 GPIO 5
- HDMI: DP2 → DP-to-HDMI bridge
- Internal camera: usb_2 + eUSB2 repeater
- Audio: headphones, headset mic and internal mics (DSP topology and UCM come
  with debondragon-support; needs `debondragon-firmware`)
- Internal speakers: **opt-in** `-speakers` devicetree (no speaker protection on Linux)
- Fan/EC driver: built but **off by default**; check with `sudo debondragon-ec-check`

Test steps and the support matrix:
https://github.com/SatoruGoj0/DebianOnDragon/blob/main/docs/hardware-testing.md

**New install:** write the ISO in DD mode, boot it from the USB-A port,
and keep Secure Boot off (https://github.com/SatoruGoj0/DebianOnDragon/blob/main/docs/install.md).
